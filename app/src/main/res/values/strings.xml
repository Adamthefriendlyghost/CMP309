        Of the numerous famous men and women associated with Kirriemuir, one stands out as iconic in the music industry. \n
        \n
        Ronald Belford \'Bon\' Scott is known worldwide as the lead singer of AC/DC from 1974 until his death in 1980. \n
        Scott lived in Kirriemuir until the age of six, moving to Australia with his family and, after performing in several other bands throughout his twenties he replaced
        lead singer Dave Evans of AC/DC.\n
        \n
        AC/DC\'s popularity grew throughout the 70\'s eventually reaching the top 20\'s in the United States with their 1979 album 'Highway to Hell'.\n
        However, on the evening of 19th February 1980, Scott died after a night out in London. The album 'Back in Black' was released by AC/DC a few months later
        as a tribute to Scott, becoming the third best-selling album in history. \n
        \n
        Scott is celebrated every year in Kirriemuir during the 'Bonfest' festival hosted by DD8 Music.
